# Secure Access DLL Example

- Interface: `CAN`
- Vendor Device: `Simulate`

## Build The DLL

You can do it with yourself method, or you can cmake. (only support x64 platform)
Steps are as follows:

1. open vs x64_x86 cross tools command prompt terminal
2. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   cd SeedKey
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -A x64
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```  

3. `dll` folder contains the pre-built dll file.

## Use The DLL

The project setup a simulate device, which can be used to test the dll. A node item attach the script(`node.ts`)

> [!TIP]
> Need x64 platform dll file

```typescript
import { SecureAccessDll } from 'ECB'
import path from 'path'

//setup dll
const sa = new SecureAccessDll(path.join(process.env.PROJECT_ROOT, 'dll', 'GenerateKeyEx.dll'))
//call the function
const seed = sa.GenerateKeyEx(
  Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  1,
  Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]),
  Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
)
console.log(seed)
```

## Others

The default dll warper follow the [Guide](https://cdn.vector.com/cms/content/know-how/_application-notes/AN-IDG-1-017_SecurityAccess.pdf), if you want to use other interface, you can build the wrapper by yourself. See the [source code](https://github.com/ecubus/EcuBus-Pro/tree/master/src/main/worker/secureAccess) for more information.
